# "Fair" IMDB Ranking

Web Scraping practice project with BeautifulSoup, Requests, CSV.
It scrapes the Top 250 Movies from IMDB, then recalculates their ranking based on number of reviews & Oscars won.


Todo:
1. Add some UI / Data Visualization.
2. Make it more general (e.g. user definable list of movies, or use bigger dataset, etc.)
3. Investigate more why multiprocessing is more performant in this case than the more obvious multithreading.
